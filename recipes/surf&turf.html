                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Whisk 1 tablespoon olive oil, butter, onion, wine, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, 
                            parsley, seafood seasoning, garlic, and black pepper together in a bowl; add shrimp. 
                            Toss to coat evenly. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for flavors to blend, 
                            at least 15 minutes.
                        </li>
                        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Coat steaks with
                            2 teaspoons olive oil; sprinkle with steak seasoning.
                        </li>
                        <li>Cook steaks on the preheated grill until they are beginning to firm and have reached your desired 
                            doneness, 5 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 
                            140 degrees F (60 degrees C).Transfer steaks to a platter and loosely tent with a piece of aluminum foil.
                        </li>
                        <li>Remove shrimp from marinade and grill until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat 
                            is opaque, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
